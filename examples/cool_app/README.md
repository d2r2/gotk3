Feature-rich GTK+3 application written in go
============================================

Aim of this sample application to show all GLIB/GTK+ components and widgets tiered together
with helpfull code patterns.

It's highly recomended to have GTK+3.12 and high installed, otherwise app will not compile.

Advantages of this demonstration:
1) All actions in application implemented via GAction component, working as entry point
for any activity in application. Advanced use of GAction utilize "action with states" with good
demonstration of such actions in menus.
2) New widgets such GHeaderBar, GPopover, and so on, are demonstrated in app.
3) Good example of preference dialog are implemented in application.
4) Helpfull code pattern are present: working with save/restore settings (via GSettings),
fullscreen mode wrap/unwrap, actions with states and others.
